## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on the classification of sea ice and leads, it does this via an implementation of unsupervised learning methods. We use both K-means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and compare our classifiction with the ESA, then compare both models performance. This content is part of a broader study of machine learning and AI and its application to satellite observation.

## Contents
- Introduction and basic implementation of K-means Clustering and GMM (example and image classification).
- Data preprocessing/cleaning and reading in useful functions.
- Rolling out the models for feature classification.
- Plotting mean waveform and standard deviation for both classifications from satellite data.
- Classification comparison across both models.
- Aligning waveforms for both sea ice and leads using correlation.
- Comparison to ESA classification.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed.
```
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Open the notebook using google colab after downloading 'MachineLearningMethods.ipynb' from the home page of this GitHub. Then link your google drive to the notebook and create a path to the data you'd like classified. Modify parameters as required to obtain the best results.

## Results and Analysis
This notebook finds that GMM performed slightly better than K-means when comparing to the classification provided by the ESA. However both models performed very well, emphasising the power of these models for efficient and accurate classification.

## Notes
- Ensure all libraries are properly installed before running the notebook.
- Ensure that when using the notebook all paths are changed to the data you'd like to classify.
- This notebook was structured for educational purposes.
- Email zcapmcl@ucl.ac.uk regarding any issues/bugs with the notebook.
